<H2 style="color:yellow;font-family:comic sans ms;color:yellow">3)Where did yoga come from?<br><br>

A)Yoga is a physical, mental and spiritual practice that originated in ancient India. First codified by the sage Patanjali in his Yoga Sutras around 400 C.E, the practice was in fact handed down from teacher to student long before this text arose.

<br>
<br>
<H2 style="color:yellow;font-family:comic sans ms;color:yellow">4)Why do people practice yoga?<br><br>

A)The survey found that people who practice yoga are more likely to be active in other forms of exercise like running or cycling, too, and that one in every three Americans said they were somewhat or very likely to practice yoga in the next 12 months. No single reason is driving people to the millennia-old practice.
<br><br>

<H2 style="color:yellow;font-family:comic sans ms;color:yellow">5)Is yoga good for your health?<BR><BR>

You've probably heard by now that yoga is good for your health. Maybe you've even tried it for yourself and discovered that it makes you feel better. A consistent practice offers a plethora of mental and physical health benefits. Some, like improved flexibility, are clearly evident.
